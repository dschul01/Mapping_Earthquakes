# Mapping Earthquakes

Utilize Javascript, APIs, Leaflet library, and GeoJSON data to create geographical maps showing global earthquake activity.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to visually show the magnitudes of earthquakes over the last seven days with circle marker's size based on each earthquakes' magnitude in relation to the Earth's tectonic plates.  An interactive map has been created to view three different map styles and three layers.  The layers allow the user the ability to filter views of all earthquakes, tectonic plates, and/or major earthquakes as they choose.

## Results
The Javascript file produces a website which provides a user multiple options on how to view global earthquake activity.  There are three different map styles; Streets, Satellite, and Light the user can choose. The three layers allow the user to filter on all earthquakes, tectonic plates and/or on the major earthquakes which have high magnitudes.  An additional legend is provided to specify the major earthquake magnitudes as seen in the screenshots below.    The user also has the ability to hover over any of the markers to see each earthquake's magnitude and location when either of the earthquake layers is selected.

### Earthquake Map 

The following images provide a view into the multiple features of the map found on the website.  Note each image shows the tectonic plates in orange linestrings:

One of three map styles for the user to choose as seen in the upper right corner ('Light' style shown) as well as a popup description of an earthquake.

The layer containing all earthquakes is selected with a popup description of the magnitude and location of an earthquake.  The bottom legend seen in the bottom right of the image shows the magnitude levels.

The layer containing major earthquakes is selected with Popup description of magnitude and location of a major earthquake.  The top legend seen in the bottom right of the image shows the magnitude levels.
